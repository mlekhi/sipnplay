        Founder, Jonathan Li, shares a passion for board games, boba, and
        delicious food, so he combined them all to become Sip & Play, Park
        Slopeâ€™s first board game cafe. It is a straightforward concept, come in
        with your friends and family to play any board game from our library of
        300+ games! We hope when you visit, you also enjoy our coffee, espresso,
        boba, sandwiches, and snacks!
